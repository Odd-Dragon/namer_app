# Overview

I want to learn more about mobile development, especially in ways that will allow cross-platform use. Flutter seems to be one of the most efficient ways to make such cross-platform apps, so I want to familiarize myself with it.

This app will generate a random compound word based on two random smaller words, and allows the user to favorite/unfavorite these words as they please.

As I said above, I wanted to familiarize myself with Flutter and Dart, and this seemed like one of the more common things to create- it serves no purpose on its own, really, but I will be using the basics of this to create a name generator app (likely for D&D, focused on fantasy names) in the near future.

# Development Environment

I used Flutter, mainly with VS Code, and did all my testing with Android Studio.

For languages, I used Dart, which I'm entirely new to, so I don't think I used any extra libraries outside of what comes standard with flutter, but I'm still inexperienced enough to not be entirely sure.

# Useful Websites

- [The Flutter Cookbook was very helpful](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [And So was this TechwithTim tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly0hAtV7EBg&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-knQWGK2IC49Q_5AnQrFpzv)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I plan to either make this app into a D&D name generator, or make a new app using similar principles. If I do that, I'll keep the mashup word generator here, but also add another generator, possibly on a different page, of first names.
- If I do that, I'll make the favoriting more robust somehow- perhaps two separate lists, that can be mixed and matched
- I'll also see about changing the words generated, so the names are slightly more coherent while still being randomized enough the user doesn't get frustrated.
